# bifurcationDiagram

Calculating population (x at 0-1 interval) of every year with the initial population and growth rate (r at 0-4 interval). 

x0 is starting / current population and xn is next year's population. So xn=r*x0*(1-x0) equation used.

Plotting the equilibrium population of every population growth rate gives the bifurcation diagram.
